## 📧 Email Template (Customize for Each!)

### Version A: Global Health Focus (Dr. Boulton, Dr. Heisler)

```
Subject: First-Year Student - Mobile Health Project for Parkinson's Screening in Kenya

Dear Professor [Name],

My name is Junho Lee, a first-year student deeply interested in global health 
and health equity. I have been following your work on [specific project/paper], 
particularly your [specific achievement in Kenya/India/community work].

I am developing a smartphone-based Parkinson's screening tool designed 
specifically for community health workers in East Africa. The motivation comes 
from a stark reality: while 70% of Parkinson's patients live in low-resource 
settings, 99% of diagnostic research focuses on high-income populations.

NeuroAccess uses Edge AI to enable:
• Offline screening (no internet required)
• CHW operation (no neurologist needed)
• Multilingual support (Swahili, Hindi, Amharic)
• Complete privacy (data never leaves the device)

I have:
✓ Built a working prototype (89% accuracy on baseline dataset)
✓ Optimized for low-end smartphones (<5MB model)
✓ Identified potential partners (Kenyatta Hospital via UMich Kenya office)
✓ Prepared IRB proposal framework

I am planning a pilot study in Nairobi this summer (pending IRB approval) 
with 10 trained CHWs screening 100 community members.

I would be incredibly grateful for:
1. Your guidance on community engagement in Kenya
2. Advice on navigating IRB for international research
3. Potential introduction to UMich Kenya office contacts
4. 15 minutes to discuss how this aligns with your program's mission

I am committed to conducting this research ethically and ensuring it benefits 
the communities involved, not just my academic portfolio.

Would you be available for a brief meeting in the coming weeks?

Thank you for your time and for the inspiring work you do.

Respectfully,
Junho Lee

### Version B: Technical AI Focus (Dr. Waljee, Dr. Najarian, Dr. Wiens)

```
Subject: Undergraduate ML Project - Cross-Lingual Voice Biomarkers for Parkinson's

Dear Professor [Name],

I am a first-year student working on a machine learning project at the 
intersection of clinical AI and health equity. Your work on [specific paper 
on fairness/bias in ML] has been particularly influential in shaping my approach.

I am developing language-agnostic voice biomarkers for Parkinson's disease 
detection, specifically targeting underserved populations in East Africa and 
South Asia where diagnostic resources are scarce.

Technical approach:
• TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference (<5MB model)
• Language-agnostic features (MFCC, jitter, shimmer, prosody)
• Quantization for low-power devices
• Cross-lingual validation (English → Swahili, Hindi, Amharic)

Key challenges I'm exploring:
1. Transfer learning across languages with different phonetic systems
2. Mitigating bias from training primarily on English/European datasets
3. Model compression without sacrificing accuracy
4. Clinical validation in resource-limited settings

I have working code and would deeply appreciate your technical guidance on:
• Feature selection for language-invariant biomarkers
• Strategies for fair model performance across diverse populations
• Validation protocols for low-resource deployment

Would you have 15-20 minutes to discuss this project? I would be happy to 
present my current results and get your feedback.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
Junho Lee

### Version C: Clinical Neurology (Dr. Bohnen, Dr. Chou)

```
Subject: Student Project - Voice-Based Parkinson's Screening Tool

Dear Dr. [Name],

I am a first-year student developing a voice-based screening tool for 
Parkinson's disease. As someone deeply interested in neurology and movement 
disorders, I have been reading your research on [specific PD research topic].

My project focuses on bringing early PD detection to underserved communities 
using smartphone voice analysis. While the technology works well in controlled 
settings (89% accuracy on UCI dataset), I need clinical guidance on:

1. Which voice features are most clinically meaningful for early PD?
2. How to validate this approach against standard clinical assessments?
3. What are the limitations of voice-only screening?
4. How might this complement (not replace) clinical diagnosis?

I am planning a pilot study in Kenya this summer and want to ensure the tool 
is clinically sound before any deployment.

Would you have 15 minutes to provide clinical perspective on this project?

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Junho Lee
